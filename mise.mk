# mise.mk — the whole make surface, forwarded to mise tasks.
#
# Consumer Makefiles `include .mise/mise.mk` and stay thin: the canonical
# lint/build/test/e2e contract the reusable CI runs, plus fmt/ci/pr/help/commit
# and every archetype extra, are mise tasks defined by this library
# (tasks/<archetype>.toml, included from the consumer's root mise.toml) with the
# pinned tools from config.toml/mise.lock on PATH inside each task — no .bin/,
# no tool-path plumbing. Extension still works both ways:
#   - make-side:  `pr: docs` adds a prerequisite (runs BEFORE `mise run pr`);
#   - mise-side:  add or redefine tasks in the repo's root mise.toml [tasks]
#     (task merging is whole-task replacement, so a redefinition wins).
